# IPC

## Overview

This project aims to implement a robust Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system tailored for microkernel-based operating systems. The focus is on creating efficient communication channels between processes while leveraging zero-copy abstractions for improved performance.

## Features

1. **Microkernel Compatibility**: Designed specifically for microkernel architectures to ensure seamless integration and optimal performance.

2. **Zero-Copy Abstractions**: Utilizes zero-copy techniques to minimize data transfer overhead, enhancing overall system efficiency.

3. **Flexible Communication Channels**: Supports various communication channels, such as message passing, shared memory, and signals, providing flexibility for different use cases.

4. **Asynchronous Communication**: Enables asynchronous communication between processes, allowing for non-blocking operations and improved responsiveness.

5. **Security**: Implements secure communication mechanisms to protect data integrity and confidentiality during inter-process communication.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the IPC system into your microkernel-based operating system:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/viniciusfdasilva/ipc.git
